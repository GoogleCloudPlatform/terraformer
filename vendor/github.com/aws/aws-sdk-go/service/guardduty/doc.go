// Package guardduty provides the client and types for making API
// requests to Amazon GuardDuty.
//
// Amazon GuardDuty is a continuous security monitoring service that analyzes
// and processes the following data sources: VPC Flow Logs, AWS CloudTrail event
// logs, and DNS logs. It uses threat intelligence feeds, such as lists of malicious
// IPs and domains, and machine learning to identify unexpected and potentially
// unauthorized and malicious activity within your AWS environment. This can
// include issues like escalations of privileges, uses of exposed credentials,
// or communication with malicious IPs, URLs, or domains. For example, GuardDuty
// can detect compromised EC2 instances serving malware or mining bitcoin. It
// also monitors AWS account access behavior for signs of compromise, such as
// unauthorized infrastructure deployments, like instances deployed in a region
// that has never been used, or unusual API calls, like a password policy change
// to reduce password strength. GuardDuty informs you of the status of your
// AWS environment by producing security findings that you can view in the GuardDuty
// console or through Amazon CloudWatch events. For more information, see Amazon
// GuardDuty User Guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/what-is-guardduty.html).

//
// Using the Client
//
// To contact Amazon GuardDuty with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.

// See aws.Config documentation for more information on configuring SDK clients.
