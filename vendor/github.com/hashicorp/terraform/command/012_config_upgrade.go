Usage: terraform 0.12upgrade [module-dir]

  Rewrites the .tf files for a single module that was written for a Terraform
  version prior to v0.12 so that it uses new syntax features from v0.12
  and later.

  Also rewrites constructs that behave differently after v0.12, and flags any
  suspicious constructs that require human review,

  By default, 0.12upgrade rewrites the files in the current working directory.
  However, a path to a different directory can be provided. The command will
  prompt for confirmation interactively unless the -yes option is given.

Options:

  -yes        Skip the initial introduction messages and interactive
              confirmation. This can be used to run this command in
              batch from a script.

  -force      Override the heuristic that attempts to detect if a
              configuration is already written for v0.12 or later.
              Some of the transformations made by this command are
              not idempotent, so re-running against the same module
              may change the meanings expressions in the module.
