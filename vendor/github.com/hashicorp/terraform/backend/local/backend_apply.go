No configuration files found!

Apply requires configuration to be present. Applying without a configuration
would mark everything for destruction, which is normally not what is desired.
If you would like to destroy everything, please run 'terraform destroy' which
does not require any configuration files.
`

const stateWriteBackedUpError = `Failed to persist state to backend.

The error shown above has prevented Terraform from writing the updated state
to the configured backend. To allow for recovery, the state has been written
to the file "errored.tfstate" in the current working directory.

Running "terraform apply" again at this point will create a forked state,
making it harder to recover.

To retry writing this state, use the following command:
    terraform state push errored.tfstate
`

const stateWriteConsoleFallbackError = `Failed to persist state to backend.

The errors shown above prevented Terraform from writing the updated state to
the configured backend and from creating a local backup file. As a fallback,
the raw state data is printed above as a JSON object.

To retry writing this state, copy the state data (from the first { to the
last } inclusive) and save it into a local file called errored.tfstate, then
run the following command:
    terraform state push errored.tfstate
`

const stateWriteFatalError = `Failed to save state after apply.

A catastrophic error has prevented Terraform from persisting the state file
or creating a backup. Unfortunately this means that the record of any resources
created during this apply has been lost, and such resources may exist outside
of Terraform's management.

For resources that support import, it is possible to recover by manually
importing each resource using its id from the target system.

This is a serious bug in Terraform and should be reported.

const earlyStateWriteErrorFmt = `Error saving current state: %s

Terraform encountered an error attempting to save the state before cancelling
the current operation. Once the operation is complete another attempt will be
made to save the final state.
