// Taking deep copies of states is an important operation because state is
// otherwise a mutable data structure that is challenging to share across
// many separate callers. It is important that the DeepCopy implementations
// in this file comprehensively copy all parts of the state data structure
// that could be mutated via pointers.

// DeepCopy returns a new state that contains equivalent data to the reciever
// but shares no backing memory in common.
//
// As with all methods on State, this method is not safe to use concurrently
// with writing to any portion of the recieving data structure. It is the
// caller's responsibility to ensure mutual exclusion for the duration of the
// operation, but may then freely modify the receiver and the returned copy
// independently once this method returns.
